# SEI33-Project1-towerDefence

Hi, this is Rex, the creator of this mini tower defence project.

The project is made with the of learning and exploring the possibilities of js, css & html working tgt in conjunction.

The constrains are that no additional libraries should be used and that only vanilla js is allowed.

I have modeled this tower defence (td) game after one of my favourite childhood games, "Flash Element TD", which has now developed into "Element TD 2", and is available on steam.

Do note that while the game works in general, there are existing issues to be resolved, which includes:
- Wonky projectile arcs and motions
- Game parameters not set ideally (Such as money, gems, costs etc...)
- Lack of upgrade capabilities for the towers
- Serious lag when too many enemies are spawned or too many projectiles are on screen
- Issues with enemy pathing when you scroll the screen simutaneously
- and many more, do let me know if you find any other pressing issues



Furthermore, there's been ideas that I was lacking in ability to implement in my 4 days of coding this project, which includes:
- Generation of an X by X grid up to the player's choice
- Generation of a randomised maze, making use of some maze algorithm
- Creating a path-finding system for the spawned enemies (the current one is hardcoded to the preset layout)
- Including a greater variety of towers
- Air enemies that can bypass terrain

With regards to the gameplay, tower defence is a real-time strategy game where waves of enemies are spawned every round (starts with clicking the play button), and your goal is to manage your gold and other resources to build the right towers at the right locations, ensuring that no enemies will be able to reach your base (in this case, your castle).

It can also be considered turn-based as the system operates by a wave by wave basis, although you are allowed to build more towers during the waves if you find that you're lacking in your defence.

By investing in the right things at the right time, you will be able to push the limits on how far you can go.

I hope you'll have fun checking out this prototype of mine.

Thank you for reading!
